## Introduction

Your deliverable for this weekend is to create a Proof Of Concept for the tech stack you'll be using.

This is particularly important if you are going to be exploring a new tech, in which case this deliverable should focus on that new tech.

## What Should It Look Like?

It highly depends on your project, but no matter what you're doing, the goal is to _make sure_ that when you start work on this on Monday, you've already hit and handled any basic roadblocks or speedbumps. The _last_ thing you want is to spend the first part of your week finding out that you're not going to be able to get your app off the ground!

Here are some quick examples.

- If you're playing with something new, it's a great idea to test that out on a basic level. For example: with TypeScript, get a Hello World display with Typescript and `create-react-app`. If you're working with a new back end, make sure you can add data in a shell according to some basic model. If you're working with a new front end technology, use it to build something that displays with it.
- If you're using an API, make sure you can hit its end points _from Postman or a route on your own back end_, AND that you're getting back all the data you might want when you move to the front end.

No matter what you're doing, the focus at this point must be not JUST planning, but also ensuring that your tech stack is a good match for what you're doing.

## Presentations

We will be presenting these proofs-of-concept on Monday morning. So have something ready!

You will NOT be judged on whether your app is "good" or "anywhere near finished" or "a real app at all", but whether you have something small but working within your choice of tech.
